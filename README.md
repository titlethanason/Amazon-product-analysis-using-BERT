# Amazon-product-analysis-using-BERT

This project aim to creating a system to analyze the feeling of Amazon customer toward their product that bought from the website. The system will classify the feeling into two categories positive and negative from the user's review on Amazon website. In this project, we focus on four categories of product including book, DVD&CD, electronic device, and home&kitchen appliances. We use BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)  which is the bi-direction encoded model designed by Google. BERT is the state-of-the-art in the natural language processing works such as text classification or text translation. However, this project can process only English text.
